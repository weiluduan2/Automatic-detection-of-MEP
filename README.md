## Model Weights

The model weights file (`best_model.pth`) is available in the releases section due to its large size. To use the model:

1. Download the model file from [Releases](https://github.com/weiluduan2/Automatic-detection-of-MEP/releases/tag/Main)
2. Place the downloaded `best_model.pth` file in the Demo/Model directory:
   project_root/
        ├── Demo/  
        │ ├── Model/  
        │ │ └── best_model.pth  
        │ └── [other demo files]  
        └── README.md
